## üéØ Main Test Results

### 1. Basic Operation Performance

| Algorithm | Set Operation (ns/op) | Get Operation (ns/op) | Mixed Operation (ns/op) |
|-----------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| LIRS      | 200,469             | 571.7                | 10,175                  |
| LRU       | 1,826               | 546.8                | 864.3                   |
| LFU       | 1,982               | 951.2                | 862.5                   |
| ARC       | 2,304               | 668.7                | 1,033                   |

**Analysis**: LIRS is slower in Set operations, mainly due to complex data structure initialization and maintenance

### 2. Zipf Distribution Access Pattern (Real-world Simulation)

| Algorithm | Hit Rate | Average Latency (ns/op) |
|-----------|----------|-------------------------|
| LIRS      | 99.19%   | 634.5                   |
| LRU       | 99.19%   | 566.7                   |
| LFU       | 99.19%   | 712.4                   |
| ARC       | 99.19%   | 707.4                   |

**Important Findings**: 
- ‚úÖ All algorithms achieve the same hit rate in realistic access patterns
